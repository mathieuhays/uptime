# uptime

Simple tool to monitor multiple URLs

## TODO

- [ ] add HTMX
- [x] Create Website View
- [x] Website View: add health-check historic table
- [ ] Website View: add option to toggle cache bypass setting?
- [ ] Website View: add option to disable crawling
- [ ] Unit test crawler
- [ ] Website View: health-check historic, highlight non 200 codes
- [ ] Website View: Show last known outage as a separate item
- [x] Website View: health-check historic, add chartjs graph

## Ideas

- [ ] Setup websockets for instant updates
- [ ] Have an image attached to each website (automated). either screenshot, social media meta image or favicon. screenshot will probably require nodejs.
- [ ] Website view: maybe infer page colour theme from target website?
- [ ] website setting: response time budget, then color code health check historic to reflect it
