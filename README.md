# uptime

Simple tool to monitor multiple URLs

## TODO

- [ ] add HTMX
- [x] Create Website View
- [x] Website View: add health-check historic table
- [ ] Website View: add option to toggle cache bypass setting?
- [ ] Website View: add option to disable crawling
- [ ] Unit test crawler

## Ideas

- [ ] Setup websockets for instant updates
- [ ] Have an image attached to each website (automated). either screenshot, social media meta image or favicon. screenshot will probably require nodejs.
- [ ] Website view: maybe infer page colour theme from target website?
